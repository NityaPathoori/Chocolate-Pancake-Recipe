Ingredients:

 1 1/3 cup of all purpose flour
 1/4 cup cocoa powder
 2 teaspoons baking powder
 1/4 teaspoon salt

 1 cup whole milk
 3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil (you can also use 45g melted butter)
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional, but add more flavor)

STEPS:

1: Mix the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into one bowl
2: In a different bowl, mix the sugar, milk, oil or butter, and vanilla extract together
3: Combine the dry and wet ingredients to make one big batch of batter
4: Mix the chocolate chips into the batter(if you are using any)
5:On a pan, spray some cooking oil and heat the pan up
6: Pour some of the batter onto the pan, wait for it to cook, and flip
7: Cook all the batter until there is none left
8: You can pour chocolate or maple syrup on your pancakes for extra flavor
9: Enjoy your pancakes!
